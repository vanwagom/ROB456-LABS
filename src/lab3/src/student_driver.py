		The example sets constant velocities, which is clearly the wrong thing to do.  Replace this
		code with something that moves the robot more intelligently.

		Parameters:
			target:		The current target point, in the coordinate frame of the robot (base_link) as
						an (x, y) tuple.
			lidar:		A LaserScan containing the new lidar data.

		Returns:
			A Twist message, containing the commanded robot velocities.
